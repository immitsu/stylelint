## Reference of deprecated media types

Several CSS media types defined in earlier specifications have been deprecated and should no longer be used. According to the CSS [Media Queries Level 4 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#media-types), the following media types are deprecated:

- `tty`
- `tv`
- `projection`
- `handheld`
- `braille`
- `embossed`
- `aural`
- `speech`

Currently, the recommended media types are:

- `all`
- `screen`
- `print`

The deprecated media types were removed because they were either never widely implemented or their use cases are now better handled by media features rather than broad device categories.
